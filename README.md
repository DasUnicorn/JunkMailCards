„When life gives you dickPics...“ 

I started to collect all the unconsencual dick pics send to me,
and after one and a half to two years I had enough to build a whole tarot set. 
One tarot set has 78 cards. 

That's a lot and people are most of the time surprised, 
so I decided to go public and realize a real tarot game, 
to show people the amount of sexual harassment I was receiving on the internet.

I wrote about my progress working on this set [in my (German) blog](https://dasunicorn.eu/willkommen-im-sexistischen-system-meine-geschichte-zum-dickpic-tarot/).
At the end of the progress the Tarot Set ended in an Colouring Book, which you can download here.
If you are interested in a single picture, you find them in the "pages" folder.

The project was formally hosted on its own site (junkmail.cards), but i stopped maintaining it.
